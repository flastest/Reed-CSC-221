This is a cool forest that has a priority queue and uses a comparator function. It was difficult to do. The HForest is really just a priority queue, and syntax gave me nightmares. HTree is similar to the last tree, and has helper functions to do stuff. All things work, but I'm mentally exhausted.

I don't even remember doing HTree, but I did it yesterday.

to make it, you can type "make andshake" for a tester for the HTree. You can type "make forest" for a tester for the HForest. 

please try to enjoy this
